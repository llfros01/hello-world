# hello-world
This is Laura introducing herself to the coding world. Formally. I hope to use GitHub during my job search by providing a repository for work samples and to store a private project on actions taken. I am hoping to learn code as I develop a resident &amp; fellow alumni database that can be used by other sponsoring institutions.
